ABC Company Employee Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The objective of this project is to preprocess the dataset, perform data analysis, create graphical representations, and extract meaningful insights about employee distribution, salary expenditure, and demographic patterns.

🔧 Data Preprocessing

The Height column was corrected by replacing its values with randomly generated numbers between 150 and 180, as instructed.

Ensured the dataset was consistent and ready for analysis before performing computations and visualizations.
