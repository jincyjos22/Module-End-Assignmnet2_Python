📊 ABC Company Employee Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the ABC Company Employee Dataset using Python.

The objective of this analysis is to examine workforce distribution, salary allocation patterns, age demographics, and the relationship between age and salary. By applying statistical techniques and visualizations, the project transforms raw employee data into meaningful business insights.

The analysis helps answer key questions such as:

How are employees distributed across teams and positions?

What is the predominant age group in the organization?

Which team and position incur the highest salary expenditure?

Is there a relationship between employee age and salary?

The findings are supported by clear graphical representations to improve interpretability and decision-making.

🛠 Technologies Used
